A deep learning-based system for classifying brain tumors from MRI images. This project includes both the model training pipeline and a web interface for real-time classification.

## Features

- Classification of four types of brain conditions:
  - Glioma
  - Meningioma
  - Pituitary
  - No Tumor
- Interactive web interface built with Streamlit
- Real-time image processing and classification
- Detailed probability breakdown for each classification
- Data augmentation for improved model robustness
- Comprehensive evaluation metrics

## Project Structure

```
brain_tumor_classification/
â”œâ”€â”€ Training/                 # Training dataset directory
â”œâ”€â”€ train_model.py           # Model training script
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py                   # Streamlit web application
â”œâ”€â”€ brain_tumor_model.keras  # Trained model file
â””â”€â”€ requirements.txt         # Project dependencies
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wolflergf/Brain_Tumor.git
cd Brain_Tumor
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Training the Model

To train the model on your own dataset:

1. Organize your dataset in the following structure:

```
Training/
â”œâ”€â”€ glioma/
â”œâ”€â”€ meningioma/
â”œâ”€â”€ pituitary/
â””â”€â”€ no_tumor/
```

2. Run the training script:

```bash
python train_model.py
```

The script will:

- Apply data augmentation
- Train the CNN model
- Generate performance metrics
- Save the trained model

### Running the Web Application

To start the web interface:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8501`

## Model Architecture

The CNN architecture consists of:

- 2 Convolutional layers with ReLU activation
- 2 MaxPooling layers
- Flatten layer
- Dense layer with 128 units
- Dropout layer (0.2)
- Output layer with softmax activation

## Performance Metrics

The model is evaluated using:

- Accuracy
- Loss
- Classification report
- Training/validation curves

## Dependencies

- TensorFlow 2.x
- Streamlit
- NumPy
- Pillow
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
